# Brackets-Verifier

This is my first C++ project that is inspired by a leet code question. Basically it will ask the user for a string, the program will check whether the string is missing a bracket or not

## Example

- String that is not missing brackets
    (Hi(I am not missing anything))

- String that is missing 1 or more brackets
    ({<Hi. I am an absolute mess)}


## Version 1.0.1

- The program will now print out the string after it has been validated.


The program is currently at version 1.0.1 and will be updated if new ideas shall arise. Until then, this will be the final product.
